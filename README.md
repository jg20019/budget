# Budget

Track income, spending and expenses in the browser. 

Users add expenses each with their own categories. Whenever
a user adds income they decide what each of their dollars
will be spent on. Another section of the app is used to
track actual spending to make sure that they are spending
money wisely. 

Because each expense has it's own category the site also
shows reporting based on week or month where money is being
spent. This should help with budgeting. 

Finally, this initial version will save information in the browser
but a planned future version will allow users to create an account
and back up data to a server so that they can use from multiple
devices.
